# Image Splitter

While creating a feed for instagram I encountered the need to split an image into a grid of equal size smaller images, in my case square.

To do this I used pillow to split and then crop the image.

## Usage
To use the image splitter just execute the main which will have an ui to select the image, the number of rows and columns to split the image into and the output directory.


## Example:
(what you will get when running the included test)

<p align="middle">
    <img src="test image.png" height="600" />
    <img src="test showcase.png" height="600" />
</p>
