# Image Splitter

While creating a feed for instagram I encountered the need to split an image into a grid of equal size smaller images, in my case square.

To do this I used pillow to split and then crop the image.

Example: (what you will get when running the included test)

<p align="middle">
    <img src="test image.png" height="600" />
    <img src="showcase image.png" width="600" />
</p>
